  <strong>Rust-native application stack for A3S Code.</strong>

  <em>Agent runtime, terminal and native UI, memory, workflows, safety,

## Overview

A3S is the monorepo for A3S Code and its Rust-first platform components. The
root repository is for orchestration only: crates under `crates/` are
independent git submodules, and applications live under `apps/`.

The primary product surface today is `a3s code`, the interactive terminal
coding agent. Native desktop clients are built with `a3s-gui`, Rust function
components, RSX view templates, and platform hosts for AppKit, GTK, and WinUI.

The stack is intentionally not a root Rust workspace and not a JavaScript UI
runtime. Web and WebView packages are auxiliary surfaces; the core product path
is Rust.

## Repository Map

| Area | Paths | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product surfaces | `crates/cli`, `apps/desktop`, `apps/box`, `apps/docs` | CLI, native apps, and documentation site. |
| Agent runtime | `crates/code`, `crates/ahp`, `crates/acl`, `crates/common` | Sessions, tools, policy, protocol, config, and shared types. |
| UI systems | `crates/tui`, `crates/gui`, `crates/webview` | Terminal UI, native RSX UI, and trusted WebView helpers. |
| State and coordination | `crates/memory`, `crates/event`, `crates/flow`, `crates/lane`, `crates/search` | Memory, events, workflows, queues, and retrieval. |
| Runtime safety and operations | `crates/box`, `crates/observer`, `crates/sentry` | Isolation, observability, and runtime control. |
| Services | `crates/boot`, `crates/gateway`, `crates/power` | Service framework, ingress, and model serving. |
| Distribution | `crates/updater`, `homebrew-tap` | CLI self-update support and Homebrew formulae. |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the published CLI.
brew install a3s-lab/tap/a3s

# Run the terminal coding agent.
a3s code
```

Local development:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Run A3S Code from source.
just code

# Run the native desktop app.
just dev

# Check the desktop app.
just desktop-check

# Run the A3S Box desktop client.
just box

# Test the GUI runtime and RSX support.
cd crates/gui
cargo test
```

## Working In This Repository

This repository root is not a Rust workspace. Do not run `cargo init`,
`cargo new`, `cargo fmt --all`, or `cargo test` from the root expecting it to
cover every component. Run Rust commands from the crate or app directory that
owns the change.

Typical component workflow:

```bash
cd crates/<component>
cargo fmt --all
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Crates are submodules, so component code and root submodule pointers are
committed separately:

```bash
cd crates/<component>
git add .
git commit -m "Describe component change"

cd ../..
git add crates/<component>
git commit -m "Update <component> snapshot"
```

Applications under `apps/` use app-local workflows. The root `justfile` only
orchestrates common entry points such as `just code`, `just dev`, and
`just desktop-check`.
