## Overview

**A3S** is a monorepo for agent infrastructure. It contains an embeddable coding-agent runtime, a MicroVM runtime, a gateway, scheduling, memory, search, and LLM-serving components.

```text
a3s-code             <- harness-driven agent runtime (Rust + Node.js + Python SDKs)
a3s-box              <- Docker-like MicroVM runtime for Linux OCI workloads
a3s-gateway          <- application-agnostic ingress/reverse proxy layer
```

**a3s-code** is a coding-agent runtime library. It exposes ACL config, tools, hooks, security policy, memory, MCP, structured output (`generate_object`), explicit planning mode, run replay, QuickJS PTC, task delegation, automatic subagent delegation, and a pluggable workspace subsystem through runtime APIs and SDKs. v3.1 adds Claude Code-style built-in subagents (`explore`, `plan`, `general`, `verification`, `review`), native `.a3s/agents` custom-agent loading, and a global `auto_parallel` / `autoParallel` switch that disables automatic parallel fan-out while keeping manual `parallel_task` available. The v3 workspace stack includes local filesystem, S3-compatible object storage (with ETag CAS, opt-in degraded search, cost-bounded operations), and an HTTP/JSON `RemoteGitBackend` that keeps the `git` tool available on workspaces that have no `.git` directory. Failures surface as a typed `ToolErrorKind` discriminator (`version_conflict`, `not_found`, `timeout`, ...) end-to-end into Node and Python SDKs, so callers branch on `.type` instead of regex-matching messages.

**a3s-box** is a MicroVM runtime. Its local Docker-like CLI is the primary product surface. Kubernetes CRI, hardware TEE, and Windows paths are integration surfaces with explicit platform limits.

**a3s-gateway** is an application-agnostic reverse proxy with middleware, routing, and privacy features.

**a3s** (the CLI) is the interactive terminal app: `a3s code` launches a Claude Code-class coding-agent TUI built on a3s-code and a3s-tui, with prebuilt binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Architecture

| Layer | Component | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent Framework | a3s-code | Embeddable coding-agent runtime with Rust, Node.js, and Python SDKs |
| VM Runtime | a3s-box | MicroVM isolation, Docker-like CLI, OCI image lifecycle |
| Ingress | a3s-gateway | Reverse proxy with middleware and routing |
| Scheduling | a3s-lane | Per-session priority queues and retry/dead-letter behavior |
| Infrastructure | a3s-power / a3s-search | LLM inference and meta search |
| Observability | a3s-observer | eBPF-based, language-agnostic AI-agent telemetry (LLM calls, tools, files, egress) |
| Security Control | a3s-sentry | Tiered (rules / LLM / agent) runtime guardrails — judges observer events, blocks dangerous actions |
| Libraries | a3s-acl / a3s-ahp / a3s-event / a3s-memory / a3s-common | Configuration, harness protocol, events, memory, shared types |
