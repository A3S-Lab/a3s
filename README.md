## Overview

A3S is a monorepo for A3S-Lab infrastructure components used to build,
package, run, observe, and control agent-based applications. The repository
root is an orchestration repository; each component under `crates/` is an
independent git submodule with its own build and release lifecycle.

The project focuses on production agent systems rather than a single runtime:

- agent runtimes and SDKs for local and hosted coding assistants
- terminal, native, and WebView UI surfaces for interactive agent workflows
- MicroVM workload isolation, policy enforcement, and runtime supervision
- durable workflows, eventing, retrieval, memory, and scheduling primitives
- ingress, model-serving, update, and distribution tooling

The project is organized around these component groups:

| Area | Components |
|---|---|
| Agent runtime and SDKs | `a3s-code`, `a3s-flow`, `a3s-ahp`, `a3s-common` |
| Workload isolation | `a3s-box` |
| Model serving and ingress | `a3s-power`, `a3s-gateway` |
| State, retrieval, and scheduling | `a3s-memory`, `a3s-search`, `a3s-lane`, `a3s-event` |
| Observability and control | `a3s-observer`, `a3s-sentry`, `a3s-acl` |
| User interfaces | `a3s-tui`, `a3s-gui`, `a3s-webview` |
| Distribution | `a3s`, `a3s-updater`, `homebrew-tap` |

The `a3s` CLI packages selected components into an end-user command-line
application. `a3s code` launches an interactive terminal coding agent built on
`a3s-code` and `a3s-tui`.

   eBPF telemetry        runtime control policy

   supporting libraries:
   a3s-flow, a3s-acl, a3s-ahp, a3s-event, a3s-memory, a3s-search,
   a3s-lane, a3s-common, a3s-tui, a3s-gui
```

Components communicate through typed APIs, protocol messages, or platform
adapters depending on the crate. The repository keeps these components separate
so each crate can be built, tested, versioned, and released independently.

## Quick start

```bash
# CLI: the interactive coding agent (`a3s code` launches the TUI)
brew install a3s-lab/tap/a3s
# or a prebuilt binary (macOS / Linux / Windows): https://github.com/A3S-Lab/Cli/releases/latest

# SDKs
npm install @a3s-lab/code        # Node.js
pip install a3s-code             # Python
cargo add a3s-code-core          # Rust
```

To work on a component from this monorepo, initialize submodules and then run
commands from the component directory:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive

cd crates/tui
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

```

Each crate lives in its own repository under the [A3S-Lab](https://github.com/A3S-Lab) org and is
vendored here as a submodule. Component-specific README files contain the build,
test, and usage details for each crate.

## Working in this repository

This repository root is not a Rust workspace. Do not run `cargo init`,
`cargo new`, `cargo fmt --all`, or `cargo test` from the root expecting it to
cover every component. Use the crate or app directory that owns the change.

Typical Rust component workflow:

```bash
cd crates/<component>
cargo fmt --all
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Because crates are submodules, changes are committed in two places:

```bash
cd crates/<component>
git add .
git commit -m "Describe component change"

cd ../..
git add crates/<component>
git commit -m "Update <component> snapshot"
```

For apps under `apps/`, use the app-local package manager and scripts. The root
`justfile` is for orchestration only.

## TUI status

`a3s-tui` is the shared terminal UI layer used by the interactive `a3s code`
experience. It includes:

- an Elm/TEA-style update loop and command model
- element trees with Flexbox layout and terminal painting
- ANSI-aware truncation, wrapping, selection, and diff rendering
- reusable components for prompts, menus, tabs, lists, tables, logs, progress,
  text input, text areas, timelines, and status surfaces
- regression coverage for narrow terminals, CJK text, ANSI styling,
  zero-width marks, stale selection state, and empty viewport behavior

During monorepo development, `crates/cli/Cargo.toml` patches `a3s-tui` to the
local `crates/tui` submodule. The CLI still pins the published crate version for
release builds, but the monorepo patch overrides resolution to `../tui` when
developing here. The `a3s code` TUI entrypoint imports `a3s_tui` directly from
`crates/cli/src/tui/mod.rs`, so local framework fixes are exercised before they
are published to crates.io. To verify the wiring:

```bash
cd crates/cli
cargo tree -i a3s-tui --locked --offline
# a3s-tui v0.1.4 (.../crates/tui)
# └── a3s v0.6.0 (.../crates/cli)
```

Recent `a3s code` surfaces are wired through shared components from `a3s-tui`:
the command palette and asset selectors use `MenuPanel`; `/model` uses
`TabbedMenuPanel`; `/memory`, `/ctx`, `/kb`, resource, and `/loop` details use
`DetailPanel`, `Timeline`, and `SectionHeader`; tool status lines use
`ToolStatusLine`; transcript gutters and user input bubbles use `GutterBlock`;
input prompt chrome uses `InputBorder` and `PromptLine`; live and completed tool
output tail previews use `OutputBlock`; live reasoning uses `WrappedPrefixBlock`;
task summaries use `ConnectorBlock`; `/compact` progress uses `Progress`;
file-edit diffs use `DiffView`; the live activity indicator and `/effort` title
use `ShimmerText`; `/effort` controls use `LevelSlider`; SPF and `/ide` chrome
uses `PanelFrame`; SPF and `/ide` file metadata use `Breadcrumb`; and the main
footer uses `SessionStatus` plus `ModeLine`. Menu bounds, selection windows,
tool status truncation, transcript gutters and input bubbles, prompt
continuation alignment, input border labels, live reasoning wrapping, completed
output tail previews, compaction progress bars, connector rows, diff wrapping,
framed panels, breadcrumbs, activity shimmer, detail rows, and footer width
handling therefore exercise the shared TUI library directly inside the
interactive CLI.
