## Overview

A3S is a monorepo for A3S-Lab infrastructure components used to build,
package, run, observe, and control agent-based applications. The repository
root is an orchestration repository; each component under `crates/` is an
independent git submodule with its own build and release lifecycle.

The project is organized around these component groups:

| Area | Components |
|---|---|
| Agent runtime and SDKs | `a3s-code`, `a3s-flow`, `a3s-ahp`, `a3s-common` |
| Workload isolation | `a3s-box` |
| Model serving and ingress | `a3s-power`, `a3s-gateway` |
| State, retrieval, and scheduling | `a3s-memory`, `a3s-search`, `a3s-lane`, `a3s-event` |
| Observability and control | `a3s-observer`, `a3s-sentry`, `a3s-acl` |
| User interfaces | `a3s-tui`, `a3s-gui`, `a3s-webview` |
| Distribution | `a3s`, `a3s-updater`, `homebrew-tap` |

The `a3s` CLI packages selected components into an end-user command-line
application. `a3s code` launches an interactive terminal coding agent built on
`a3s-code` and `a3s-tui`.

   eBPF telemetry        runtime control policy

   supporting libraries:
   a3s-flow, a3s-acl, a3s-ahp, a3s-event, a3s-memory, a3s-search,
   a3s-lane, a3s-common, a3s-tui, a3s-gui
```

Components communicate through typed APIs, protocol messages, or platform
adapters depending on the crate. The repository keeps these components separate
so each crate can be built, tested, versioned, and released independently.

## Quick start

```bash
# CLI: the interactive coding agent (`a3s code` launches the TUI)
brew install a3s-lab/tap/a3s
# or a prebuilt binary (macOS / Linux / Windows): https://github.com/A3S-Lab/Cli/releases/latest

# SDKs
npm install @a3s-lab/code        # Node.js
pip install a3s-code             # Python
cargo add a3s-code-core          # Rust
```

Each crate lives in its own repository under the [A3S-Lab](https://github.com/A3S-Lab) org and is
vendored here as a submodule. Component-specific README files contain the build,
test, and usage details for each crate.
