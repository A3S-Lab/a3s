## Overview

A3S is a monorepo for A3S-Lab infrastructure components used to build,
package, run, observe, and control agent-based applications. The repository
root is an orchestration repository; each component under `crates/` is an
independent git submodule with its own build and release lifecycle.

The project focuses on production agent systems rather than a single runtime:

- agent runtimes and SDKs for local and hosted coding assistants
- terminal, native, and WebView UI surfaces for interactive agent workflows
- MicroVM workload isolation, policy enforcement, and runtime supervision
- durable workflows, eventing, retrieval, memory, and scheduling primitives
- ingress, model-serving, update, and distribution tooling

The project is organized around these component groups:

| Area | Components |
|---|---|
| Agent runtime and SDKs | `a3s-code`, `a3s-flow`, `a3s-ahp`, `a3s-common` |
| Workload isolation | `a3s-box` |
| Model serving and ingress | `a3s-power`, `a3s-gateway` |
| State, retrieval, and scheduling | `a3s-memory`, `a3s-search`, `a3s-lane`, `a3s-event` |
| Observability and control | `a3s-observer`, `a3s-sentry`, `a3s-acl` |
| User interfaces | `a3s-tui`, `a3s-gui`, `a3s-webview` |
| Distribution | `a3s`, `a3s-updater`, `homebrew-tap` |

The `a3s` CLI packages selected components into an end-user command-line
application. `a3s code` launches an interactive terminal coding agent built on
`a3s-code` and `a3s-tui`.

   eBPF telemetry        runtime control policy

   supporting libraries:
   a3s-flow, a3s-acl, a3s-ahp, a3s-event, a3s-memory, a3s-search,
   a3s-lane, a3s-common, a3s-tui, a3s-gui
```

Components communicate through typed APIs, protocol messages, or platform
adapters depending on the crate. The repository keeps these components separate
so each crate can be built, tested, versioned, and released independently.

## Quick start

```bash
# CLI: the interactive coding agent (`a3s code` launches the TUI)
brew install a3s-lab/tap/a3s
# or a prebuilt binary (macOS / Linux / Windows): https://github.com/A3S-Lab/Cli/releases/latest

# SDKs
npm install @a3s-lab/code        # Node.js
pip install a3s-code             # Python
cargo add a3s-code-core          # Rust
```

To work on a component from this monorepo, initialize submodules and then run
commands from the component directory:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive

cd crates/tui
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

```

Each crate lives in its own repository under the [A3S-Lab](https://github.com/A3S-Lab) org and is
vendored here as a submodule. Component-specific README files contain the build,
test, and usage details for each crate.

## Working in this repository

This repository root is not a Rust workspace. Do not run `cargo init`,
`cargo new`, `cargo fmt --all`, or `cargo test` from the root expecting it to
cover every component. Use the crate or app directory that owns the change.

Typical Rust component workflow:

```bash
cd crates/<component>
cargo fmt --all
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Because crates are submodules, changes are committed in two places:

```bash
cd crates/<component>
git add .
git commit -m "Describe component change"

cd ../..
git add crates/<component>
git commit -m "Update <component> snapshot"
```

For apps under `apps/`, use the app-local package manager and scripts. The root
`justfile` is for orchestration only.

## TUI status

`a3s-tui` is the shared terminal UI layer used by the interactive `a3s code`
experience. It includes:

- an Elm/TEA-style update loop and command model
- element trees with Flexbox layout and terminal painting
- ANSI-aware truncation, wrapping, selection, and diff rendering
- reusable components for prompts, menus, tabs, lists, tables, logs, progress,
  text input, text areas, timelines, and status surfaces
- regression coverage for narrow terminals, CJK text, ANSI styling,
  zero-width marks, stale selection state, and empty viewport behavior

During monorepo development, `crates/cli/Cargo.toml` patches `a3s-tui` to the
local `crates/tui` submodule. The CLI still pins the published crate version for
release builds, but the monorepo patch overrides resolution to `../tui` when
developing here. The `a3s code` TUI entrypoint imports `a3s_tui` directly from
`crates/cli/src/tui/mod.rs`, so local framework fixes are exercised before they
are published to crates.io. To verify the wiring:

```bash
cd crates/cli
cargo tree -i a3s-tui --locked --offline
# a3s-tui v0.1.4 (.../crates/tui)
# └── a3s v0.6.0 (.../crates/cli)
```

Recent `a3s code` surfaces are wired through shared components from `a3s-tui`:
the command palette and asset selectors use `MenuPanel`; the tool approval
overlay uses `ChoicePrompt`; `/model` uses `TabbedMenuPanel`; `/plugin` skill
toggles use `MenuPanel`; `/memory`, `/ctx`, `/kb`, resource, and `/loop`
details use `DetailPanel`, `Timeline`, and `SectionHeader`; `/memory` type
labels use `Badge`; tool status lines use
`ToolStatusLine`; RemoteUI view links use `InlineAction`; transcript gutters and
user input bubbles use `GutterBlock`; input prompt chrome uses `InputBorder` and
`PromptLine`; live and completed tool output tail previews use `OutputBlock`;
live reasoning uses `WrappedPrefixBlock`; pinned plan rows and task summaries
use `Checklist`; `/kb` delete confirmations use `Confirm`; live output rows use `ConnectorBlock`; live tool activity and
stdout tail previews use `ActivityBlock`; OS login/configuration warnings use
`Alert`; overlay menus and prompts are composed with `TextOverlay`; `/ide` flash
messages use `Toast`; `/compact` progress uses `Progress`; `/memory` importance
bars also use `Progress`; memory, knowledge, and resource panel separators use
`Divider`; file-edit diffs use `DiffView`; the live activity indicator and
`/effort` title use `ShimmerText`; `/effort` controls use `LevelSlider`; detail
text wrapping uses `Paragraph`; `/theme` uses `PreviewPanel`; the `@` file
picker uses `TreePicker`; SPF and `/ide` chrome uses `PanelFrame`; SPF and
`/ide` file metadata use `Breadcrumb`; `/ide` active editor rows use
`CursorLine`; the `/top` header uses `StatusBar`; the `/top` process table uses
`DataTable` and `Sparkline` for CPU/MEM trends; `/loop` details use `KeyValue`;
and the main footer uses `SessionStatus` plus `ModeLine`, with context fill
rendered through the shared `Meter`. The main transcript viewport appends its
right gutter through `Scrollbar`. Menu bounds, selection windows, approval
choices, approval overlay wheel browsing and click-to-approve or deny, `/model`
account tab mouse switching, `/theme` wheel preview and click-to-apply,
`/effort` wheel/click adjustment, slash command wheel browsing and click-to-run,
`@` file picker wheel browsing and click-to-insert, `/agent` picker wheel
browsing and click-to-develop, `/mcp` picker wheel browsing and
click-to-develop, `/skill` picker wheel browsing and click-to-develop,
`/flow` picker wheel browsing and click-to-open, `/plugin` wheel browsing and
click-to-toggle, RemoteUI action links, tool status truncation, shared alert
rows, overlay composition, toast rows, live activity blocks, top process trends,
loop key-value summaries, KB delete confirmations, transcript gutters and input
bubbles, prompt continuation alignment, input border labels, shared
display-width wrapping for live reasoning and detail text, completed output tail
previews, pinned plan checklists, task status summaries, compaction progress
bars, pinned memory importance bars, transcript scrollbars, IDE cursor rows,
top status actions, panel dividers, connector rows, diff wrapping, framed
panels, breadcrumbs, activity shimmer, detail rows, `/model` tab hit-testing,
`/effort` slider hit-testing, slash command palette hit-testing, approval
overlay hit-testing, `/theme` preview hit-testing, `@` file picker hit-testing,
`/agent` picker hit-testing, `/mcp` picker hit-testing, `/skill` picker
hit-testing, `/flow` picker hit-testing, `/plugin` overlay hit-testing, footer
context meters, and footer width handling therefore exercise the shared TUI
library directly inside the interactive CLI.
