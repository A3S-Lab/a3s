## Overview

**A3S** is a monorepo for agent infrastructure. It contains an embeddable coding-agent runtime, a MicroVM runtime, a gateway, scheduling, memory, search, and LLM-serving components.

```text
a3s-code             <- harness-driven agent runtime (Rust + Node.js + Python SDKs)
a3s-box              <- Docker-like MicroVM runtime for Linux OCI workloads
a3s-gateway          <- application-agnostic ingress/reverse proxy layer
```

**a3s-code** is a coding-agent runtime library. It exposes ACL config, tools, hooks, security policy, memory, MCP, structured output (`generate_object`), explicit planning mode, run replay, QuickJS PTC, and task delegation through runtime APIs and SDKs.

**a3s-box** is a MicroVM runtime. Its local Docker-like CLI is the primary product surface. Kubernetes CRI, hardware TEE, and Windows paths are integration surfaces with explicit platform limits.

**a3s-gateway** is an application-agnostic reverse proxy with middleware, routing, and privacy features.

## Architecture

| Layer | Component | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent Framework | a3s-code | Embeddable coding-agent runtime with Rust, Node.js, and Python SDKs |
| VM Runtime | a3s-box | MicroVM isolation, Docker-like CLI, OCI image lifecycle |
| Ingress | a3s-gateway | Reverse proxy with middleware and routing |
| Scheduling | a3s-lane | Per-session priority queues and retry/dead-letter behavior |
| Infrastructure | a3s-power / a3s-search | LLM inference and meta search |
| Libraries | a3s-acl / a3s-ahp / a3s-event / a3s-memory / a3s-common | Configuration, harness protocol, events, memory, shared types |
