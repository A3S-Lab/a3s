## Overview

A3S is the orchestration repository for A3S Code, A3S Box, A3S Bench, and their
Rust-first platform components. Crates under `crates/` are independent git
submodules, and applications live under `apps/`.

The `a3s` command is the unified product entrypoint: `a3s code` launches the
interactive coding agent, `a3s box` manages isolated runtimes, and `a3s bench`
runs reproducible evaluations of coding agents and automated systems. Local
Code, Runtime, provider/model, and Bench workflows do not require an A3S OS
login unless the selected remote capability requires one.

The stack is intentionally not a root Rust workspace and not a JavaScript UI
runtime. Web and WebView packages are auxiliary surfaces; the core product path
is Rust.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the published CLI.
brew install a3s-lab/tap/a3s

# Run the terminal coding agent.
a3s code

# Run the browser Code workspace.
a3s web

# Code is included with a3s. Box and Bench install on first real use.
a3s list
a3s box ps

# Optional components can also be prepared explicitly.
a3s install code   # verify/repair the included Code installation
a3s install box
a3s install bench
```

`a3s update` remains the Code self-update alias. Use
`a3s update code|box|bench` to update one component explicitly; updating a
missing optional component tells you to install it first.

Manage account-owned and configured model routes without copying Claude Code,
Codex, or A3S OS credentials into `config.acl`:

```bash
a3s login                         # A3S OS browser OAuth
a3s account list                  # Claude Code, Codex, and A3S OS status
a3s model list                    # config.acl plus signed-in account models
a3s model use codex/<model>       # persist the A3S Code model route
```

Run the short Bench conformance task after installing the stable Bench control
component. Signed-out local execution defaults to Docker:

```bash
a3s bench list
a3s bench run quick_file_edit --agent <candidate-adapter>
a3s bench result
```

Bench v0.1.0 packages one short conformance task and 51 locally runnable
long-horizon Task/Judge adapters. The long-horizon catalog is not a permanent
task boundary. Local runs remain `local_unofficial`; official evaluation also
requires signed Task admission and matching Runtime evidence.

Local development:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Run A3S Code from source.
just code

# Run the default development surface.
just dev

# Build and run the browser Code workspace.
just web

# Run the A3S Box desktop client.
just box

# Test the GUI runtime and RSX support.
cd crates/gui
cargo test
```

## Working In This Repository

This repository root is not a Rust workspace. Do not run `cargo init`,
`cargo new`, `cargo fmt --all`, or `cargo test` from the root expecting it to
cover every component. Run Rust commands from the crate or app directory that
owns the change.

Typical component workflow:

```bash
cd crates/<component>
cargo fmt --all
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Crates are submodules, so component code and root submodule pointers are
committed separately:

```bash
cd crates/<component>
git add .
git commit -m "Describe component change"

cd ../..
git add crates/<component>
git commit -m "Update <component> snapshot"
```

Applications under `apps/` use app-local workflows. The root `justfile` only
orchestrates common entry points such as `just code`, `just dev`, `just web`,
and `just box-check`.
