# Custom Subagents

Subagents are specialized agents that run in isolated child sessions with their own permissions, system prompts, and tool access. A3S Code ships with 5 built-in subagents and supports user-defined subagents via YAML or Markdown files.

## Built-in Subagents

| Agent | Description | Max Steps | Permissions |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `explore` | Fast codebase exploration (read-only) | 20 | read, grep, glob, ls |
| `general` | General-purpose multi-step execution | 50 | Full tool access |
| `plan` | Architecture and planning (read-only) | 30 | read, grep, glob |
| `title` | Session title generation (hidden) | 1 | None |
| `summary` | Session summarization (hidden) | 5 | read |

## Defining Custom Subagents

### YAML Format

Create a YAML file in your agents directory:

```yaml
# ~/.a3s/agents/security-reviewer.yaml
name: security-reviewer
description: Reviews code for security vulnerabilities and best practices
mode: subagent
hidden: false
max_steps: 25
can_spawn_subagents: false

permissions:
  allow:
    - read
    - grep
    - glob
    - ls
  deny:
    - write
    - edit
    - bash
    - patch

prompt: |
  You are a security code reviewer. Analyze the codebase for:
  - SQL injection, XSS, CSRF vulnerabilities
  - Hardcoded secrets and credentials
  - Insecure cryptographic practices
  - Missing input validation
  - Unsafe deserialization

  Report findings with severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low),
  affected file and line, and recommended fix.
  Never modify any files — report only.
```

### Markdown Format

Or use Markdown with YAML frontmatter (the body becomes the system prompt):

```markdown
# ~/.a3s/agents/db-migration.md
---
name: db-migration
description: Database migration specialist
mode: subagent
max_steps: 40
permissions:
  allow: [read, write, edit, bash, grep, glob]
  deny: [web_fetch, web_search]
---
You are a database migration specialist. You can:
- Generate migration files (SQL or ORM-specific)
- Validate migration safety (no data loss, reversibility)
- Run migrations in development environments
- Generate rollback scripts

Always check for:
1. Backward compatibility with the current schema
2. Data preservation during column renames/type changes
3. Index impact on large tables
4. Foreign key constraint ordering
```

### With Model Override

Use a different model for specific subagents via `provider/model` format:

```yaml
name: quick-search
description: Fast search agent using a smaller model
mode: subagent
max_steps: 10
model: anthropic/claude-haiku-4-20250514
permissions:
  allow: [read, grep, glob, ls]
prompt: |
  You are a fast search agent. Find the requested information
  quickly and return concise results. Do not explain — just find.
```

## Loading Subagents

Configure agent directories in your agent config:

```hcl
agent_dirs = ["~/.a3s/agents", "/shared/team-agents"]
```

All `.yaml` and `.md` files in these directories are automatically loaded into the `AgentRegistry` at startup.

## How Delegation Works

```
Parent Session
  │
  ├─ delegate("security-reviewer", "Review auth module")
  │    │
  │    ├─ 1. Look up AgentDefinition in AgentRegistry
  │    ├─ 2. Create child session with agent's permissions
  │    ├─ 3. Apply agent's system prompt
  │    ├─ 4. Execute task in isolated agentic loop
  │    ├─ 5. Return result to parent
  │    └─ 6. Child session ID preserved for reference
  │
  └─ Parent continues with subagent's result
```

Key isolation guarantees:
- Child session has its own context window (no parent context leakage)
- Permissions are restricted to the agent definition's policy
- Tool access is filtered per the agent's allow/deny rules
- `max_steps` prevents runaway execution
- `can_spawn_subagents: false` prevents recursive delegation

## AgentDefinition Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | Unique agent identifier |
| `description` | string | yes | What the agent does (shown to LLM) |
| `mode` | `subagent` or `primary` | no | Agent mode (default: `subagent`) |
| `hidden` | bool | no | Hide from listing (default: `false`) |
| `max_steps` | number | no | Maximum tool rounds |
| `can_spawn_subagents` | bool | no | Allow recursive delegation (default: `false`) |
| `permissions.allow` | string[] | no | Allowed tool names |
| `permissions.deny` | string[] | no | Denied tool names |
| `model` | string | no | Model override in `provider/model` format |
| `prompt` | string | no | System prompt for the agent |
