# Skills System

Skills are Markdown files that extend agent behavior. They can inject system prompts, define custom tools, or create specialized agent personas. Compatible with Claude Code Skills format.

## Skill Format

```markdown
# ~/.a3s/skills/deploy.md
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy to production
allowed_tools: Bash(kubectl:*)
---
You are a deployment specialist. Run kubectl apply to deploy the application.
Always verify the deployment status after applying changes.
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | yes | Unique skill identifier |
| `description` | yes | What the skill does |
| `allowed_tools` | no | Restrict which tools this skill can use (glob patterns) |

### Skill Kinds

Skills are automatically classified into three kinds:

| Kind | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `instruction` | Injects system prompt context (no tools) |
| `tool` | Defines custom tool backends (binary, HTTP, script) |
| `agent` | Creates a specialized agent persona |

## Loading Skills

<Tabs groupId="lang" items={['TypeScript', 'Python']}>
<Tab value="TypeScript">
```typescript
// Load a single skill by name
await session.loadSkill('deploy');

// Load all skills from a directory
await session.loadSkills('~/.a3s/skills');

// List loaded skills
const skills = await session.listSkills();
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Python">
```python
await session.load_skill("deploy")
await session.load_skills("~/.a3s/skills")
skills = await session.list_skills()
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## On-Demand Loading

The agent has three native tools for skill management:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_skills` | Search for skills on GitHub (zero-dependency API) |
| `install_skill` | Download and install a skill from GitHub |
| `load_skill` | Load an installed skill into the current session |

The agent can autonomously discover and load skills when it needs capabilities beyond its built-in tools.

## Skill Tool Filters

When a skill specifies `allowed_tools`, the agent loop enforces these restrictions. A skill with `allowed_tools: Bash(kubectl:*)` can only use bash commands starting with `kubectl`.

This provides per-skill sandboxing — a deployment skill can't accidentally run `rm -rf /`, even if the session's permission policy would allow it.

## Skill Directories

Configure skill directories in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "skillDirs": ["~/.a3s/skills", "/shared/team-skills"],
  "agentDirs": ["~/.a3s/agents"]
}
```

Skills in these directories are available for loading but not automatically active — they must be explicitly loaded into a session.
