# Skills System

Skills are Markdown files that extend agent behavior. They can inject system prompts, define custom tools, or create specialized agent personas. Compatible with Claude Code Skills format.

## Skill Format

```markdown
# ~/.a3s/skills/deploy.md
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy to production
allowed_tools: Bash(kubectl:*)
---
You are a deployment specialist. Run kubectl apply to deploy the application.
Always verify the deployment status after applying changes.
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | yes | Unique skill identifier |
| `description` | yes | What the skill does |
| `allowed_tools` | no | Restrict which tools this skill can use (glob patterns) |

### Skill Kinds

Skills are automatically classified into three kinds:

| Kind | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `instruction` | Injects system prompt context (no tools) |
| `tool` | Defines custom tool backends (binary, HTTP, script) |
| `agent` | Creates a specialized agent persona |

## Loading Skills

Skills are loaded from directories specified in your agent config:

```hcl
skill_dirs = ["~/.a3s/skills", "/shared/team-skills"]
```

Skills in these directories are available for loading but not automatically active — they must be referenced or triggered during a session.

## Runtime Skill Discovery

The agent can also discover and install skills at runtime using the built-in skill discovery tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `search_skills` | Search GitHub for available skills |
| `install_skill` | Install a skill from GitHub |
| `load_skill` | Load and register an installed skill |

This allows the agent to extend its own capabilities on-demand without requiring a restart or config change.

## Skill Tool Filters

When a skill specifies `allowed_tools`, the agent loop enforces these restrictions. A skill with `allowed_tools: Bash(kubectl:*)` can only use bash commands starting with `kubectl`.

This provides per-skill sandboxing — a deployment skill can't accidentally run `rm -rf /`, even if the session's permission policy would allow it.
