# Tasks

A3S Code uses a unified `Task` struct for both planning and todo tracking. The `Task` type replaces the former separate `PlanStep` and `Todo` types — whether the agent is decomposing a complex request into an execution plan or maintaining a session-scoped task list, the same model is used throughout.

## Task Model

Each task has the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `String` | Unique task identifier |
| `content` | `String` | Task description |
| `status` | `TaskStatus` | Current lifecycle state |
| `priority` | `TaskPriority` | `High`, `Medium`, or `Low` |
| `tool` | `Option<String>` | Suggested tool for execution |
| `dependencies` | `Vec<String>` | Task IDs that must complete first |
| `success_criteria` | `Option<String>` | How to verify completion |

### TaskStatus

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Pending` | Not yet started |
| `InProgress` | Currently being executed |
| `Completed` | Successfully finished |
| `Failed` | Execution failed |
| `Skipped` | Skipped (dependency failed or no longer needed) |
| `Cancelled` | Manually cancelled |

### TaskPriority

| Priority | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `High` | Execute first |
| `Medium` | Default priority |
| `Low` | Execute after higher-priority tasks |

## Task Lifecycle

Tasks transition through statuses as the agent works:

```
Pending → InProgress → Completed
                     → Failed
                     → Skipped
                     → Cancelled
```

The agent emits a `TaskUpdated` event whenever the task list changes, so streaming consumers can track progress in real time.

## Execution Plans

For complex tasks, the planning system creates an `ExecutionPlan` — an ordered set of tasks with dependency awareness.

### Plan Structure

```
ExecutionPlan
├── goal: "Refactor auth module to use JWT"
├── complexity: Complex
├── steps:
│   ├── 1. Analyze current auth implementation     [Completed]
│   ├── 2. Design JWT token structure              [InProgress]
│   ├── 3. Implement JWT generation and validation [Pending]     (depends on 2)
│   ├── 4. Update middleware to use JWT            [Pending]     (depends on 3)
│   ├── 5. Update tests                           [Pending]     (depends on 4)
│   └── 6. Verify all tests pass                  [Pending]     (depends on 5)
└── estimated_steps: 6
```

### Complexity Levels

The planner evaluates task complexity to choose an execution strategy:

| Complexity | Strategy | When Used |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| `Simple` | `DIRECT` | Single generation, no planning needed |
| `Medium` | `ITERATIVE` | Generate → tool → reflect → repeat |
| `Complex` | `PLANNED` | Create plan first, then execute steps |
| `VeryComplex` | `PARALLEL` | Independent subtasks executed in parallel |

The `AUTO` strategy uses task analysis to dynamically select the best approach.

### Dependency-Aware Execution

`ExecutionPlan::get_ready_steps()` returns only tasks whose dependencies are all `Completed`. This ensures correct execution order without manual sequencing:

```rust
let ready = plan.get_ready_steps();
// Returns tasks where all dependencies are satisfied
```

Progress is calculated automatically:

```rust
let progress = plan.progress(); // 0.0 to 1.0
```

## Planning Mode

Enable planning with the `planning_enabled` flag in `AgentConfig`:

```rust
let config = AgentConfig {
    planning_enabled: true,
    // ...
};
```

When enabled, the `LlmPlanner` generates a structured plan before execution begins. If the LLM planner fails (e.g., malformed response), a heuristic fallback creates a reasonable default plan.

### LLM Planner

The `LlmPlanner` sends a structured prompt to the LLM asking it to decompose the task into steps. The response is parsed as JSON:

```json
{
  "goal": "Add input validation to all API endpoints",
  "complexity": "Complex",
  "steps": [
    { "content": "Identify all API endpoints", "priority": "high", "tool": "Grep" },
    { "content": "Add validation middleware", "priority": "high" },
    { "content": "Write tests for validation", "priority": "medium" }
  ]
}
```

### Fallback Planner

When the LLM planner fails, the fallback heuristic creates a 3-step plan:

1. **Analyze** — Understand the current state (priority: high)
2. **Implement** — Make the required changes (priority: high)
3. **Verify** — Confirm the changes work (priority: medium)

## Goal Tracking

When `goal_tracking` is enabled, the agent extracts a measurable goal from the user's prompt and monitors progress throughout execution.

### Goal Structure

```rust
pub struct AgentGoal {
    pub description: String,
    pub success_criteria: Vec<String>,
    pub progress: f32,          // 0.0 to 1.0
    pub achieved: bool,
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub achieved_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Goal extraction** — The planner analyzes the user prompt and extracts a goal with success criteria
2. **Progress monitoring** — After each agent turn, the goal tracker evaluates completion
3. **Achievement check** — Compares current state against success criteria, reports remaining work

```
User prompt: "Add input validation to all API endpoints"
  │
  ├── Goal: "All API endpoints validate their input parameters"
  ├── Success criteria:
  │   ├── Each endpoint has validation middleware
  │   ├── Invalid input returns 400 with error details
  │   └── Tests cover validation edge cases
  └── Progress: 0% → 33% → 66% → 100%
```

## Events

Task-related events emitted during execution:

| Event | Fields | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `TaskUpdated` | `session_id`, `tasks` | Task list changed (added, status change, completed) |

The `TaskUpdated` event includes the full current task list, so consumers always have the latest state.

## Storage

Tasks are stored in `SessionData` alongside conversation history and memory. The `tasks` field uses `#[serde(alias = "todos")]` for backward compatibility with sessions persisted before the type unification.

When a session is restored from storage, its task list is restored too — the agent picks up where it left off.
