# Planning & Goal Tracking

A3S Code can create structured execution plans before starting work and track progress toward goals. Planning is configurable per session.

## Create a Plan

```typescript
const plan = await client.createPlan(sessionId, 'Refactor auth module');
// Returns structured plan with steps, complexity analysis, and estimated effort
```

```python
plan = await client.create_plan(session_id, "Refactor auth module")
```

The planner analyzes the prompt, assesses complexity, and generates a step-by-step plan. Two modes:

| Mode | How it works |
|------|-------------|
| LLM-powered | Calls the LLM for complexity analysis and plan creation |
| Heuristic fallback | Uses prompt length as complexity proxy (Simple < 50 words, Medium < 150, Complex < 300, VeryComplex ≥ 300) |

## Goal Tracking

Extract goals from prompts and check progress:

```typescript
const goal = await client.extractGoal(sessionId, 'Improve test coverage to 90%');
const check = await client.checkGoalAchievement(sessionId, goal, 'Current coverage: 85%');
```

```python
goal = await client.extract_goal(session_id, "Improve test coverage to 90%")
check = await client.check_goal_achievement(session_id, goal, "Current coverage: 85%")
```

## Configuration

Enable or disable planning per session:

```typescript
await client.configureSession(sessionId, {
  planningEnabled: true,
  goalTracking: true,
});
```

## RPCs

| RPC | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `createPlan(sessionId, prompt, context)` | Create an execution plan |
| `getPlan(sessionId, planId)` | Get an existing plan |
| `extractGoal(sessionId, prompt)` | Extract goal from prompt |
| `checkGoalAchievement(sessionId, goal, currentState)` | Check goal progress |
