# Built-in Tools

A3S Code ships with 11 built-in tools that cover file operations, shell execution, search, and web access. Tools are defined declaratively in Markdown and parsed at startup.

## Tool Reference

| Tool | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `bash` | Execute shell commands | `git status`, `npm install` |
| `read` | Read files with line numbers | View source code |
| `write` | Create/overwrite files | Create new files |
| `edit` | String replacement editing | Modify existing code |
| `patch` | Apply unified diff patches | Complex multi-line edits |
| `grep` | Search file contents (ripgrep) | Find function definitions |
| `glob` | Find files by pattern | `**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.rs` |
| `ls` | List directory contents | Explore project structure |
| `web_fetch` | Fetch web content | Download documentation |
| `web_search` | Search the web | Query multiple search engines |
| `cron` | Manage scheduled tasks | Create/list/run cron jobs |

## File Operations

### `read`

Read file contents with line numbers. Supports offset and limit for large files.

```json
{
  "path": "src/main.rs",
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 100
}
```

### `write`

Create or overwrite a file. The tool automatically creates parent directories.

```json
{
  "path": "src/config.rs",
  "content": "pub struct Config {\n    pub port: u16,\n}\n"
}
```

### `edit`

Replace a specific string in a file. Useful for targeted modifications.

```json
{
  "path": "src/main.rs",
  "old_string": "fn main() {",
  "new_string": "fn main() -> Result<()> {"
}
```

### `patch`

Apply a unified diff patch. Best for complex multi-line edits.

```json
{
  "path": "src/lib.rs",
  "diff": "--- a/src/lib.rs\n+++ b/src/lib.rs\n@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@\n+use anyhow::Result;\n use std::io;\n"
}
```

## Search

### `grep`

Search file contents using ripgrep patterns. Supports regex, globs, and context lines.

```json
{
  "pattern": "fn.*async",
  "path": "src/",
  "glob": "*.rs",
  "context": 2
}
```

### `glob`

Find files matching a glob pattern.

```json
{
  "pattern": "src/**/*.rs"
}
```

### `ls`

List directory contents with file sizes and types.

```json
{
  "path": "src/"
}
```

## Shell

### `bash`

Execute shell commands. Commands run in the session's workspace directory.

```json
{
  "command": "cargo test --lib -- test_name"
}
```

## Web

### `web_fetch`

Fetch content from a URL. Returns text content extracted from HTML.

```json
{
  "url": "https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/"
}
```

### `web_search`

Search the web using multiple search engines.

```json
{
  "query": "rust async trait object",
  "engine": "google"
}
```

## Scheduling

### `cron`

Manage scheduled tasks with cron expressions or natural language.

```json
{
  "action": "create",
  "name": "backup",
  "schedule": "every day at 2am",
  "command": "backup.sh"
}
```

Supported natural language formats:
- English: `every 5 minutes`, `daily at 2am`, `every monday at 9:30`
- Chinese: `每5分钟`, `每天凌晨2点`, `每周一上午9点30分`

## File Version History

All file-modifying tools (`write`, `edit`, `patch`) automatically capture a snapshot before making changes. You can:

- View the diff between versions
- Restore any previous version
- Track all modifications made during a session

## Extending with Custom Tools

Beyond built-in tools, A3S Code supports:

- [Skills](/docs/code/skills) — Markdown-based prompt extensions with tool permissions
- [MCP](/docs/code/mcp) — External tools via Model Context Protocol
- [LSP](/docs/code/lsp) — Code intelligence via Language Server Protocol
