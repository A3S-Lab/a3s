# Todo Tracking

Each session maintains a todo list for tracking multi-step tasks. The agent creates, updates, and completes todos as it works through complex requests.

## Todo Structure

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `content` | string | Task description |
| `status` | enum | `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `blocked` |
| `priority` | enum | `high`, `medium`, `low` |
| `created_at` | timestamp | When the todo was created |
| `completed_at` | timestamp | When the todo was completed |

## How It Works

When the agent receives a complex task, it may decompose it into todos:

```
User: "Set up CI/CD for this project"

Agent creates todos:
  ☐ [high] Create GitHub Actions workflow file
  ☐ [high] Add build and test steps
  ☐ [medium] Add linting step
  ☐ [medium] Configure deployment to staging
  ☐ [low] Add badge to README
```

As the agent works, it updates todo status:

```
  ✅ [high] Create GitHub Actions workflow file
  ✅ [high] Add build and test steps
  🔄 [medium] Add linting step          ← in_progress
  ☐ [medium] Configure deployment to staging
  ☐ [low] Add badge to README
```

## Context Integration

The todo list is included in the agent's context, so it always knows what work remains. This prevents the agent from losing track of subtasks in long-running sessions.

Todos persist with the session — if a session is restored from storage, the todo list is restored too.
