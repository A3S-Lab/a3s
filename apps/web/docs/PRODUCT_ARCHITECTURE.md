# A3S Code Product Architecture

## Scope

This architecture implements the A3S Code journey defined in
[PRODUCT_BLUEPRINT.md](PRODUCT_BLUEPRINT.md). It excludes future super-app
products and disconnected backend capability browsers.

## Shell and navigation model

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    ActivityBar[Activity Bar] --> Code[Code product]
    Code --> TaskLibrary[Task Library]
    TaskLibrary --> Draft[New-task preparation]
    TaskLibrary --> Task[Current Task]
    Task --> Conversation
    Conversation --> ResultEntry[Artifact or review entry]
    ResultEntry --> Results[Result Workspace]
    Results --> Overview
    Results --> Files
    Results --> Browser
    Results --> Changes
    ActivityBar --> Settings
```

Navigation state has four distinct levels:

| Level | Owner | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product / system | `ActivityBar` | Code, Settings |
| Object | `TaskLibrary` | New task, selected task |
| Supporting plane | `ResultWorkspace` | Closed, docked, full screen |
| Result mode and artifact | `WorkspaceModeSwitcher`, `ArtifactTabs` | Overview, Files, Browser, Changes, selected tab |

Product navigation never owns task actions. Opening a result never changes the
selected task. Result modes are not routes and do not replace Conversation.
Overlays never become hidden page-level navigation.

## Runtime layout

                │   └── TaskComposer
                └── ResultWorkspace           optional, resizable
                    ├── ResultWorkspaceHeader

                    ├── WorkspaceModeSwitcher
                    └── ResultWorkspaceBody
                        ├── ModeNavigator
                        └── ArtifactViewport
```

The active mode supplies the navigator and viewport content:

```text
Overview → ResultNavigator      + OverviewViewport
Files    → FileNavigator        + FileViewport
Browser  → PreviewNavigator     + BrowserViewport
Changes  → ChangedFileNavigator + DiffViewport
```

Search, dialogs, mode selection, and the command palette are transient support
surfaces. Task parameters remain inside `TaskComposer`. New-task preparation
does not instantiate empty active-task or result components.

At wide desktop sizes, Result Workspace is a resizable peer of Conversation.
Around 1024 px it becomes an overlay. Full screen promotes the same workspace
instance; it does not mount another editor or duplicate state.

## Feature boundaries

### `features/tasks`

Owns task selection, drafts, messages, semantic execution, inline operational
detail, follow-up queue, task controls, artifact entries, delivery, and recovery.

It does not own repository or preview truth. It opens an addressable result but
cannot claim that workspace-wide changes were authored by the task.

### `features/result-workspace`

Owns the supporting-plane lifecycle, mode selection, artifact tabs, focus,
resizing, full-screen state, task-scoped restoration, and composition of result
modes.

It does not fetch domain data or implement file, preview, or Git mutations. It
adapts typed mode contracts into one stable workspace shell.

The existing `features/workspace` implementation should evolve into this
boundary rather than coexist with a duplicate right-panel system.

### `features/files`

Owns workspace tree state, the authoritative file/diff tab model, per-file dirty
content, Monaco model identity, search scope, file conflicts, replacement, and
configuration validation. The service remains authoritative about disk
content.

### `features/preview`

Owns backend-provided preview targets, lifecycle state, selected target,
refresh, bounded navigation, diagnostics, and retry. It is absent when the
service exposes no usable target.

### `features/changes`

Owns authoritative workspace Git status, changed-file metrics, complete
original/modified diff documents, stage, unstage, commit, and commit receipts.
It never infers task provenance.

### `features/settings`

Owns account connection, model defaults, theme, updates, and service
information. It renders as a shell-level dialog that preserves the current
product surface and underlying route. Failed mutations retain the last
authoritative value.

### `features/code`

Composes controllers and bootstraps authoritative service, account, model,
session, task-control, message, artifact, filesystem, preview, and Git state. It
does not contain visual components for unrelated future products.

### `design-system/primitives`

Contains interaction primitives only: buttons, icon buttons, dialogs, tabs,
popovers, status, split handles, and model combobox. Domain meaning stays in
feature components.

## Result-mode contract

Every mode implements a typed contract equivalent to:

```typescript
interface ResultModeDefinition {
  id: "overview" | "files" | "browser" | "changes";
  label: string;
  isAvailable: boolean;
  navigator: ResultNavigatorDescriptor;
  openArtifact(artifact: ArtifactReference): ResultTab;
  getEmptyState(): ResultEmptyState;
}
```

The actual types may follow local conventions, but the ownership constraints
are required:

- availability is derived from useful data or service capability;
- an artifact has a stable identity, type, task reference, and workspace
  reference where applicable;
- opening the same artifact focuses one tab rather than duplicating it;
- mode components do not own docked/full-screen/close state;
- the shell does not interpret file, preview, diff, or verification content.

## State flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    UI[Feature component] --> Action[Feature action interface]
    Action --> Controller[Feature controller]
    Controller --> API[codeApi]
    API --> Service[A3S Code service]
    Service --> Controller
    Controller --> State[Valtio app state]
    State --> UI
```

State ownership:

- service responses own sessions, messages, controls, output, filesystem,
  preview capability, preview lifecycle, and Git truth;
- `appState` owns the current authoritative snapshot plus selected task and
  shared Result Workspace UI state;
- per-task client state owns selected mode, tabs, selected artifact, navigator
  width, workspace width, scroll restoration keys, and drafts;
- local storage is best-effort for safe UI continuity only;
- component-local state owns bounded popover, dialog input, and focus state;
- local-storage failure degrades to in-memory continuity and reports one useful
  warning.

Controllers update authoritative UI state only after a successful mutation or
an explicit optimistic operation with rollback. Reconnect uses the same
bootstrap path as initial load so health-only success cannot produce a false
connected state.

## Result Workspace state machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Docked: open artifact or review action
    Docked --> Docked: switch mode / select tab
    Docked --> FullScreen: expand
    FullScreen --> Docked: restore
    Docked --> Closed: close
    FullScreen --> Closed: close
    Closed --> Docked: reopen last safe state
```

An unresolved dirty artifact guards transitions that would discard its draft.
Switching tasks stores the current task's safe workspace state and restores the
destination task's state. It never transfers the selected artifact by position.

## Core task workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Draft[New or selected task draft] --> Context{Need file context?}
    Context -->|Yes| FileSelect[Files: inspect and select]
    FileSelect --> Draft
    Context -->|No| Send[Send instruction]
    Send --> Running[Execution stream]
    Running --> Permission{Permission required?}
    Permission -->|Allow| Running
    Permission -->|Deny| Safer[Offer safer continuation]
    Running --> Delivery{Verification evidence?}
    Delivery -->|No| Reply[Ordinary assistant reply]
    Delivery -->|Yes| Summary[Delivery and artifact entries]
    Summary --> Open[Open relevant result]
    Open --> Inspect[Overview, Files, Browser, or Changes]
    Inspect --> Fix[Continue with reviewed correction]
    Inspect --> Commit[Review and commit]
    Fix --> Running
    Commit --> Draft
```

While running, a new instruction enters the task's visible queue. Stop and
Queue remain separate. Stopping does not silently execute queued work.

## Result review workflows

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Entry[Conversation result entry] --> Open[Open Result Workspace]
    Open --> Overview
    Open --> Files
    Open --> Browser
    Open --> Changes
    Overview --> Artifact[Select artifact]
    Files --> Edit[Inspect or correct]
    Browser --> Verify[Verify behavior]
    Changes --> Diff[Review diff]
    Diff --> Commit[Stage and commit]
    Artifact --> Continue[Continue task]
    Edit --> Continue
    Verify --> Continue
    Commit --> Continue
```

Search retains its searched query, line, and column. Replace is blocked when the
input no longer matches the result set or an affected file has unsaved content.
Binary files never enter the text save path. Preview navigation remains within
the service-defined target boundary. Git mutations preserve review context on
failure.

## Overlay and focus rules

- Only one modal dialog owns focus at a time.
- Dialogs restore focus to their trigger and support Escape unless a mutation
  is in progress.
- The command palette lists only actions valid for the current task state.
- The mode switcher is a non-modal popover and restores focus to its trigger.
- Search is a Files-mode support surface, not a global product view.
- Permission decisions live in the execution that they block.
- Full screen preserves the same Result Workspace focus and state graph.
- Closing the Result Workspace returns focus to the artifact entry or header
  action that opened it.
- A failed action keeps the relevant surface open with an inline retry path.

## API boundary

`src/lib/api.ts` contains only endpoints exercised by the current product.
Backend availability is not sufficient reason to add a client wrapper. New API
methods are added together with an owned controller action, visible journey
step, error state, and test.

```

Migration must move existing ownership rather than duplicate it. Components do
not call `fetch` or construct service clients. Files split when they own more
than one journey concern, not merely to create more component names.

## Acceptance boundary

A component is product-complete only when:

- it has a clear previous and next journey step;
- loading, empty, success, failure, reconnect, and disabled states are honest;
- keyboard and focus behavior are defined;
- repeated submission and stale state are guarded;
- destructive or irreversible effects are scoped and explicit;
- it remains usable at 1440 px and compact desktop around 1024 px;
- its removal would leave a named gap in the core journey.
